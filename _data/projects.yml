      <p>The U.K. is inching closer to Brexit.</p>
      <p>Since the referendum in 2016, Brexit has a big effect on the economy: the Bank of England has raised interest rates, the pound is weak against the dollar, and growth has slowed.</p>
  end: > 
      <p>I charted the change in some of the most important economic indicators using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>.</p>
      <p>This gives both a high-level overview and the ability to drill down and take a closer look at the economic indicators.</p>

      <p>In the City of London, opinion splits on whether leaving the European Union will be a boon or the end of finance as we know it.</p>
  end: > 
      <p>The Wall Street Journal interviewed five business people to find out what Brexit means to them.</p>
      <p>Using reactive JavaScript library <a href="https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/">RxJS</a>, I put together a package that tracked player state across videos.</p>
      <p>With state tracked, it became easy to add little features to make a beautiful experience for the user – videos pause when out of view and play when they're scrolled to.</p>

    <p class="award">Longlisted: Kantar's Information is Beautiful Award</p>
    <p>Before the public sees U.K. economic data, some government employees know the figures.</p>
    <p>And when the government release numbers, it moves markets.</p>
    <p>But research, revealed by the Wall Street Journal, backs up traders' suspicions:</p>
    <p>For certain economic indicators, prices drift <em>before</em> the announcement.</p>
    <p>So someone must be leaking the data.</p>
  end: >
    <p>To show these movements, I designed a series of charts using <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>.</p>
    <p>Each shows the average drift of price changes before the announcement.</p>
    <p>We <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonleefrench/status/841696320842825729">recreated</a> the online charts for the print edition of the Wall Street Journal.</p>

    <p>If the U.K. leaves the EU without a deal, tariffs for goods would default to World Trade Organization levels.</p>
    <p>This could mean paying more for everything from petroleum to potatoes... <p>... From jams to jellies...
    <p>... From orange juice to olive oil.</p>
  end: >
    <p>We scraped data from the WTO and HMRC to find how much of each commodity is imported and how much the tariffs could be worth after a no-deal Brexit.</p>
    <p>A chart animates as the story scrolls, highlighting interesting and unusual products and commodities.</p>
    <p>And there's an easily-sharable dashboard to find out exactly how much – for example – <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/what-a-no-deal-brexit-could-mean-for-trade-with-the-eu/?code=040620&page=1&search=cheese">cheese</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/what-a-no-deal-brexit-could-mean-for-trade-with-the-eu/?code=850710&page=1&search=batteries">batteries</a> or <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/what-a-no-deal-brexit-could-mean-for-trade-with-the-eu/?code=040620&page=1&search=pineapples">pineapples</a> are worth.</p>

      <p>Many banks and insurance companies are making plans to ensure they can continue business if the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29.</p><p>But where will they go?</p>
  end: >
      <p>The Wall Street Journal asked more than 150 financial-service companies their about their plans after Brexit.</p>
      <p>Using a slick collection of maps, created with <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>, we broke out different industries – asset managers, fintech firms, market infrastructure platforms and insurers – to show which company is moving where.</p>

      <p>It was supposed to be a landslide...</p>
      <p>I developed an election night dashboard to track results (and the strength of the pound) as they came in.</p>
      <p>When the BBC announced the shock hung-parliament exit poll, the pound plummeted.</p>
  end: >
      <p>Our dashboard provided a view of results as they came in, and a drill-down into who gained seats where.</p>
      <p>The charts, created with <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>, were also embedded on the WSJ homepage on election night.</p>
